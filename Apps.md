## Context based question answering
With the advent of large language models (LLM), chatbots ara capable of imitating human behavior. While LLMs have a great common knowledge, answering to questions regarding special knowledge requires fine-tuning of language models. For context based question answering, a typical method is to use prompt injection, or retrieval augmented generation. For getting started with the method, see the [LLM tool](https://github.com/hollosigergely/tool-falcon) and the [Context Injection Tool](https://github.com/hollosigergely/prompt-ci).
