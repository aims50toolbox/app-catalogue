# AIMS5.0 AI Toolbox Application Catalogue

This catalogue contains the main use-cases and application of the project AIMS5.0, providing tools to implement AI applications using reusable tools. To read about the AI Toolbox, please read the [paper](). For getting started, please read the [tutorials](). For getting started with the AI Toolbox, check the [demo tool](https://github.com/hollosigergely/demo-tool).

# Applications

## Geofencing
For basic geofencing, pleas check the [Sentinel tool](https://github.com/hollosigergely/sentinel-tool)

## Context based question answering
With the advent of large language models (LLM), chatbots ara capable of imitating human behavior. While LLMs have a great common knowledge, answering to questions regarding special knowledge requires fine-tuning of language models. For context based question answering, a typical method is to use prompt injection, or retrieval augmented generation. For getting started with the method, see the [LLM tool](https://github.com/hollosigergely/tool-falcon) and the [Context Injection Tool](https://github.com/hollosigergely/prompt-ci).

## Robotic arm grasping
For determine the object pose in the camera of the robotic arm, check [6D pose estimation tool](https://github.com/hollosigergely/pose_estimation_ros).
